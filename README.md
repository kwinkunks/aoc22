It's [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). No funny business this year, just no frills Python 3.11. Okay, maybe NumPy in an emergency.

## Diary

- Day 1 &mdash; Calorie counting &mdash; the usual kind of warmup, with the only real issue being parsing the 'paragraph'-style input. For the main task, I initially had a silly function simply taking the max, then refactored to sum the top `n` elves.
