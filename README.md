# aoc22

It's [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). No funny business this year, just no frills Python 3.11. Okay, maybe NumPy in an emergency. And I'm using type hints with more deliberation than I usually do, including running MyPy.


## Diary

- Day 1 &mdash; Calorie counting &mdash; the usual kind of warmup, with the only real issue being parsing the 'paragraph'-style input. For the main task, I initially had a silly function simply taking the max, then refactored to sum the top `n` elves.
- Day 2 &mdash; Rock paper scissors &mdash; slightly fiddly RPS game, but the non-overlapping scores allow a hacky approach to Part 2, which essentially wants the inverse problem: the move corresponding to a given outcome. Used [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for the first time.
